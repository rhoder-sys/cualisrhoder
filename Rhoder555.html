    <h2>Heuristic Review of the System</h2>

    <h3>Visibility of System Status</h3>
    <p>There are no progress bars or alerts to indicate when the system will be available. For example, if it is taking a moment to load or there is something wrong, adding a progress bar would resolve this issue. Additionally, if there are any issues with the system as a whole, such as it being down for a period of time for maintenance, they could add a message at the top of the page.</p>

    <h3>Match Between the System and the Real World</h3>
    <p>The search bar is mostly helpful when using Boolean search operators. Using plain language generates results that are not as relevant. For example, when searching for World War II, the first result only came up because it includes the word “World,” while searching “World War II” (using quotation marks to ensure the whole phrase is searched for) yields results that mention World War II. Users who are not familiar with this search language would not be able to search efficiently, since Boolean operators aren’t used in people’s everyday life nor in their natural language. That said, there is a “Search help” section that does give an overview of how to best search using JSTOR, including how to use Boolean operators and keywords rather than plain language.</p>

    <h3>User Control and Freedom</h3>
    <p>Since The Tower archives are part of the larger JSTOR database, there are no “emergency exits” that could allow users to undo their actions, should they find themselves on the main site, rather than the archive-specific section. The “home” buttons are quite confusing. While you can click the JSTOR and Catholic University logos to go to their respective “homepages,” the only way to get back to the main page for The Tower archives is to click “The Tower” in the navigation bar, which is not at the very top of the page (where it is for most websites), but a little bit farther down. Moreover, the text for this section is quite small considering this is the only way users can return to The Tower’s main page, other than using the browser’s back button repeatedly until they get back to that page. That said, when looking at a specific issue, there is a “Back to results” arrow at the top of the page, so users can clearly go back to their original search. One way this issue could be resolved is by adding a “Back to The Tower” or “Tower Homepage” button at the top of the page with an arrow, in the same way there is a “Back to results” button with an arrow at the top of the page. Another quick fix would be to change the color of “The Tower” in the navigation bar, either to the dark red that is consistent with the rest of the website’s color pattern or by putting it in a dark red box with white text to mirror the login and download buttons on the rest of the website.</p>

    <h3>Consistency and Standards</h3>
    <p>As mentioned previously, the website is inconsistent in the way it presents its “homepage” buttons. To return to both the CUA and JSTOR main pages, users can click their respective logos. Since The Tower doesn’t have a logo, and it is technically a subpage within the CUA collections, the only way to return to the main page is to click “The Tower” in the navigation bar at the top of the page, which is inconsistent with the rest of the website’s setup. This could result in users going to the main page of the wrong section, which, as I mentioned earlier, makes it even harder to return to The Tower’s website. While this format does follow the general conventions regarding subpages, and the navigation bar does provide a way to return to earlier sections of the website, the website could be clearer in how it represents its navigation information. One way this issue could be fixed is by adding a tower or newspaper icon next to “The Tower” in the navigation menu. They could also add a tower or newspaper icon that is separate from the navigation bar that links to the archive’s homepage at the top of the webpage.</p>

    <h3>Error Prevention</h3>
    <p>There aren't many error prevention measures in place on the archive website, but there are measures taken to help users correct common errors. For instance, when a keyword search yields no results, they provide a list of suggestions that might correct any errors the user made in their search. These suggestions include “check your spelling,” “broaden your search by selecting ‘all content,’” “clear your search filters,” and “See Search Help” which includes a link to the “Search Help” page. While these suggestions are helpful, if someone is looking at material from The Tower archives, suggesting they try searching “all content” actually takes them out of the archival material and guides them to separate parts of the website that do not include material from The Tower. It leads them to sources unrelated to their research goals. One way to prevent this error would be to add a pop-up message, asking, “Are you sure you want to exit The Tower archives?” with an additional option of choosing one of two buttons, either “Yes, take me to the main site” or “No, take me back to The Tower archives.”</p>

    <h3>Recognition Rather than Recall</h3>
    <p>The system has some features that allow users to rely on recognition rather than recall. For example, the navigation bar at the top of the page allows users to see which time period of The Tower archives they are exploring. Putting both “The Tower 1992-1940” at the top of the page and including the specific date the issue was published, allows the users to better trace back to the section they were looking at to find similar information. That said, there are no features that indicate to users that they have already looked at a source. One way this could be indicated would be to change the color of the link after a user has clicked on it. (Usually, the text changes to purple in other systems in the industry.) This would allow them to recognize the sections they had already visited, rather than forcing them to recall them.</p>

    <h3>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h3>
    <p>The system has a few shortcuts to improve user efficiency. The primary feature is the navigation bar at the top of the page, which allows people to trace their steps back from page to page. That said, this bar, as previously mentioned, is quite small, and unless you know to look for it, it could actually reduce user efficiency if they spend time using the browser’s back button and looking for a more prominent navigation feature, rather than using the navigation bar. Another efficient feature the archives have is a “cite” button that appears when looking at a specific issue. This button generates citations for the issue in APA, MLA, and Chicago style. There is even a “copy” button next to each style of citation, so users don’t have to manually copy down or use keyboard shortcuts to copy the citations. It also allows users to export the citation to various reference websites including RefWorks, EasyBib, and Zotero. While there is a disclaimer indicating users should double-check the citations before using them, they at least provide a starting point for citing archival materials on the website.</p>
    <p>In terms of flexibility, there aren’t easily found shortcuts. As for customizations, most of them have to do with the search function. There is the ability to use search filters, which can narrow down results by language, access type, date, and content type, and a “sort by” dropdown menu, which allows you to sort by title alphabetically, newest, oldest, creator, and resolution.</p>

    <h3>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3>
    <p>The overall site design is minimalistic. They use a simple red, black, and white color palette, which is consistent with the rest of the JSTOR database. When searching through the database, there is no unnecessary information, as all of the text is used to provide information about the available source. As a result, the design calls attention to the archival material, which the website is meant to highlight.</p>

    <h3>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Error</h3>
    <p>Since one of the main functions of the website is the ability to search through the archival feature, there are clear guidelines on what to do if a user makes a mistake while searching. If a search yields no results, there is a list of suggestions that both indicate possible problems and solutions. The “no results found” page suggests that users check their spelling, broaden their search to include “all content,” clear their search filters, or go to the “Search help” page if they need more help. All of this information is written in plain language with no jargon. It’s easily found on the page. While they don’t use any of the traditional error-message visuals like red text, they do bold “no results found.”</p>

    <h3>Help and Documentation</h3>
    <p>On the homepage of the website, there is a “search help” button, that takes users to a page with a variety of information and tips on how to use the system’s search feature. This includes how to find resources, start research, find content users have access to, search for and within journals or books, and how to check if a source is peer-reviewed. Additionally, this page includes a list of links to helpful resources on searching, including an introduction to searching on JSTOR; keyword vs semantic searching; Boolean operators; truncation, wildcards, and proximity; finding a specific phrase, title, or author; and how to browse collections. Since The Tower archives are a collection on JSTOR, the last of these resources outlines the best ways to browse on The Tower’s website. Moreover, because the search function works best using Boolean operators, this resource could be particularly helpful for users who are not familiar with that type of search.</p>

<h2>System Strengths</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The system is optimized for an audience of academics. Since the host site is a database and The Tower archive website is meant to highlight archival material, it makes sense that it would be built like other archive databases, which typically include similar search features such as filters and Boolean operators. This means that for people working in the field, these features will be familiar and intuitive to them. Furthermore, the archives have many of the traditional database features including citation tools (export to EasyBib, NoodleTools, RefWorks, etc,) and it creates citations for the issues in different citation styles. Other features include the ability to download the issues, a save feature (although this requires you to make an account), and a sidebar of “Related text” that comes up when you’re looking at an issue. All of this means the target audience has been kept in mind in the creation of the system.</li>
    <li>Another strength of the system is the way in which it allows you to look at the archival material by era. Since the material featured in the archive is older, sorting through by time period makes it easier for users to browse through issues during an era of their choosing. The website has sections laid out in periods of 20 years. This allows you to easily narrow down your search. You can also sort within those sections by oldest, newest, and sequential order, making it easier to look for results from a specific period of time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>System Weaknesses</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The main strength of the website, which is that it’s optimized for its main user base, is also a major weakness of the system. The website can be incredibly hard to navigate for users who are not academics or are not used to using databases. Often searches are only effective when using Boolean operators, which aren’t intuitive for people who aren’t used to using them. While there are resources on how to optimize your search, these are often linked in small text and are easily overlooked. Moreover, the actual “search help” page has so much information (much of which uses academic jargon), that users might become overwhelmed or discouraged. 
</li>
    <li>Also, since The Tower archives are posted on a host website (JSTOR) it’s too easy for a user to accidentally exit The Tower section and enter the JSTOR archives as a whole. The only way to get back to The Tower homepage is by clicking “The Tower” in the navigation bar, which is incredibly small, and not intuitive. Clicking a traditional sign for the homepage (like the JSTOR logo at the top of the page), takes you out of The Tower archives and to the JSTOR home page. From there, there is no way to get back to the archives other than using the browser’s back button.</li>
    <li>Additionally, when you are looking at an issue, you can’t easily search for other issues within the archives. The search bar that appears at the top of the page is for the whole database, not just The Tower archives, which could result in users finding results from sources they weren’t supposed to be using.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Comparison of Results from Heuristic Review and Mini-Usability Test</h3>
	<p>Both my heuristic review and the mini-usability test found the website hard to navigate. Even though I’m familiar with JSTOR and other databases, I still found there was a learning curve to navigating the website that included a lot of trial and error. For the person doing the mini-usability test, the website was basically unusable. The suggestions on how to improve searches, while helpful on the surface, weren’t helpful in instances in which the user didn’t think they were making any errors, such as when all of the search terms were spelled correctly. When searching with a time constraint, looking through the long list of “search help” resources isn’t as quick a fix as one might think.</p>
	<p>Another common issue that we both had was getting back to the homepage, since the link back to it is in such an inconvenient spot. It’s so small and easy to miss, even for someone who would expect it to be in the navigation bar. Many of these errors could have been prevented if the “Searching: Browse Collections” resource page were the primary source of help for The Tower archives. This page outlines how to browse, filter lists, refine results, and view items specifically when looking at a collection. Currently, this page is buried within the “Search help” page, at the bottom of a long list of other search resources. Also, as previously mentioned, differentiating the button to return to The Tower archives homepage from the other text on the page would make navigating the site much easier.</p>
	<p>The “search help” link, regardless of where it is on the webpage, is always quite small and easy to miss. Moreover, since many of the search errors were because both my colleague and I weren’t automatically using Boolean operators, one suggestion to fix this issue would be to add a short description of what Boolean operators are and how to use them underneath the search bar on the homepage. This would encourage users to use the operators right away, saving them from wasting time on trial-and-error searching that frequently yields no relevant results.</p>
